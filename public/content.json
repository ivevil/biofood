An organic product is a product that is grown without the use of chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides, growth hormones, GMOs, etc. Moreover, a few years before the start of the cultivation of organic products, the land on which they will be cultivated must be completely cleared of the chemicals used earlier in order to prevent contact with new plants. If the farmer meets all these conditions, then he can receive an official certificate of organic production. Many seniors will tell you that all food used to be organic because so many chemicals were not used. In fact, chemical fertilizers and pesticides have been used for years not only by large producers, but also by farmers who grow for their own needs. According to experts, all products were organic until the introduction of nitrogen fertilizers in the early 20th century. Organic products are considered to be the most natural and healthy. The rich nutritional value of organic fruits and vegetables is the main reason for their demand both in the domestic and international markets. What are bio products? According to the European regulation, a bio-product is the same organic product and they do not differ from each other. The truth is, the difference is only in our personal perception. Some polls have shown that more people trust the “bio” marker than “organic”. Also, the use of these terms varies around the world. In Europe and surrounding countries, the term bio is more popular, while in English-speaking countries (USA, UK, Australia) you will more often come across the term “organic”. In conclusion, we want to say that “organic” and “bio” products are no different and you can trust certified producers – their product will definitely become a useful and important part of your healthy diet, as well as take care of the environment.",
